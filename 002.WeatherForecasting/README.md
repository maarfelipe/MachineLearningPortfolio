# Weather Forecasting

Weather forecasting is the task of forecasting weather conditions for a given location and time. With the use of weather data and algorithms, it is possible to predict weather conditions for the next n number of days.

For forecasting weather, I need a dataset containing historical weather data based on a particular location. I found a dataset on Kaggle based on the Daily weather data of New Delhi.

# Project Details

This project involves the use of several technologies for data analysis and visualization in Python. 

The primary libraries used include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express for data handling, analysis, and visualization. Additionally, the Facebook Prophet model is used for time-series forecasting. 

Pandas and NumPy are used for data manipulation and analysis, while Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for data visualization. Plotly Express is used for creating interactive plots, and the Prophet model is used for time-series forecasting. 

Overall, the project utilizes a range of powerful technologies to analyze and visualize weather data, providing insights into temperature, humidity, and wind speed changes over time in Delhi.
