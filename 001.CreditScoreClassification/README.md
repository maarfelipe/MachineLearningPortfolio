# Credit Score Classification with Machine Learning

Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness. It helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness.

## Credit Score Classification

There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

1. Good
2. Standard
3. Poor

A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution. For the task of Credit Score Classification, we need a labelled dataset with credit scores.

# Project Details

In this project, I analyzed a credit score dataset to explore the relationship between various factors and credit scores. I used Python programming language along with Pandas, NumPy, Plotly Express, Plotly Graph Objects, and Plotly IO libraries to import, manipulate, and visualize the data.

I started by importing the dataset and checking for any null values in the data. Then, I analyzed the impact of various factors such as occupation, annual income, monthly in-hand salary, number of bank accounts, number of credit cards, average interest rates, number of loans, and delay in payments on credit scores. For each factor, I created a box plot visualization to understand the relationship between the factor and credit score.

Based on my analysis, I've found that having a higher annual income and monthly in-hand salary positively impacts credit scores. However, having more than 5 bank accounts or credit cards negatively impacts credit scores. Additionally, having an average interest rate of more than 15% and taking more than 3 loans at a time negatively impact credit scores. Delaying credit card payments by 5-14 days is acceptable, but delaying payments for more than 17 days negatively impacts credit scores.

This project can be helpful for individuals to understand how various factors impact their credit scores and how they can improve their credit scores. It can also be useful for financial institutions to analyze the creditworthiness of individuals and make informed decisions about granting loans or credit cards.
