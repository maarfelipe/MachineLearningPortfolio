# Credit Score Classification with Machine Learning

Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness. It helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness.

## Credit Score Classification

There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

1. Good
2. Standard
3. Poor

A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution. For the task of Credit Score Classification, we need a labelled dataset with credit scores.
