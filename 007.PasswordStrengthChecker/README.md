# Password Strength Checker

Password Strength Checker is an application that checks how strong a password is. Some popular password strength meters use machine learning algorithms to predict the strength of your password.

## How to Create a Password Strength Checker?

A password strength checker works by understanding the combination of digits, letters, and special symbols you use in your password. It is created by training a machine learning model on a labelled dataset of different combinations of letters and special symbols people use in passwords. The model learns from data about what combinations of letters and symbols can be classified as a solid or weak password.

So to create an application to check the strength of passwords, we need to have a labelled dataset about different combinations of letters and symbols. I found a dataset on Kaggle to train a machine learning model to predict the strength of a password. We can use that data for this task

# Project Details

In this project, I used Python programming language and various libraries to train a machine learning model that predicts the strength of passwords. The main libraries used were pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and getpass. Pandas and numpy were used to manipulate and analyze the data, while scikit-learn was used for tokenization, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Getpass was used to securely prompt the user for a password input.

I believe the code was well produced as I followed best practices such as importing necessary libraries at the beginning, adding comments to the code, and organizing the code into functions. Additionally, I checked for null values in the data, removed invalid entries, and converted the numeric values in the strength column to their corresponding string values.

This solution could be used in the real world to help individuals and organizations evaluate the strength of their passwords. For example, a website could implement this password strength checker to encourage users to create stronger passwords that are less vulnerable to hacking attempts. Additionally, password strength checkers could be used by security experts to assess the effectiveness of their password policies and provide recommendations for improving them. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of machine learning in solving real-world problems and highlights the importance of using strong passwords to protect sensitive information.
