# Website Traffic Forecasting

Website Traffic Forecasting means forecasting traffic on a website during a particular period. The dataset I am using for Website Traffic Forecasting is collected from the daily traffic data of thecleverprogrammer.com. It contains data about daily traffic data from June 2021 to June 2022. 

Here is a daily traffic data of a website we collected. Below are all the features in the data:

1. Date: Date of the record
2. Views: Total number of views in the day

Forecast traffic on the website by analyzing the past yearâ€™s traffic data of the website.

# Project Details

This project aims to forecast website traffic for Thecleverprogrammer.com using time series analysis and forecasting techniques. The dataset contains daily traffic data for the website and is analyzed using the Python programming language.

The project utilizes various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Statsmodels to perform data analysis, visualization, and time series modeling. The project involves checking for missing values, converting the date column to datetime format, and visualizing the daily traffic using the Plotly library.

The analysis of the dataset shows that the website traffic exhibits seasonality, with higher traffic during weekdays and lower traffic during weekends. The SARIMA model is used to forecast the website traffic for the next 50 days. The model is trained using the determined values of p, d, and q obtained from the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots.

The project is well constructed and follows standard procedures for time series forecasting using SARIMA. However, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of the model and make necessary adjustments. Metrics such as MSE and MAPE can be used to evaluate the model's performance.

In the real world, website traffic forecasting can be useful for website owners to predict future traffic trends and make necessary adjustments to their website content and resources. This can help them to optimize their website and improve user experience. Additionally, website traffic forecasting can be useful for businesses that rely on website traffic for revenue generation, such as e-commerce websites and online advertising platforms. Accurate traffic forecasting can help them to optimize their advertising and marketing strategies and make informed business decisions.
