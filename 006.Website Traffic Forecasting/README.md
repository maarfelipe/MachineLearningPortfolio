# Website Traffic Forecasting

Website Traffic Forecasting means forecasting traffic on a website during a particular period. The dataset I am using for Website Traffic Forecasting is collected from the daily traffic data of thecleverprogrammer.com. It contains data about daily traffic data from June 2021 to June 2022. 

Here is a daily traffic data of a website we collected. Below are all the features in the data:

1. Date: Date of the record
2. Views: Total number of views in the day

Forecast traffic on the website by analyzing the past yearâ€™s traffic data of the website.
