# Password Strength Checker

Password Strength Checker is an application that checks how strong a password is. Some popular password strength meters use machine learning algorithms to predict the strength of your password.

## How to Create a Password Strength Checker?

A password strength checker works by understanding the combination of digits, letters, and special symbols you use in your password. It is created by training a machine learning model on a labelled dataset of different combinations of letters and special symbols people use in passwords. The model learns from data about what combinations of letters and symbols can be classified as a solid or weak password.

So to create an application to check the strength of passwords, we need to have a labelled dataset about different combinations of letters and symbols. I found a dataset on Kaggle to train a machine learning model to predict the strength of a password. We can use that data for this task
