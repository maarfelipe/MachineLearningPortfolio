# Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio! This portfolio showcases my ongoing work and projects related to data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Projects

### 1. [Hotel Reviews Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/maarfelipe/hotel_reviews_sentiment_analysis)
- **Project Status**: Completed
- **Date**: October, 2023
- **Description**: In this project, I analyzed and visualized a hotel reviews dataset, performed sentiment analysis, and presented the results, shedding light on customer sentiment and review ratings.

### 2. [Skin Cancer Detection](https://github.com/maarfelipe/skin_cancer_detection)
- **Project Status**: Completed
- **Date**: October, 2023
- **Description**: I have developed a machine learning model for analyzing skin lesion images. The code is proficient in recognizing and categorizing lesions into seven distinct types, accompanied by concise explanations. Additionally, the model provides information regarding whether the identified lesion exhibits cancerous characteristics.
  
### 3. [Credit Score Classification](https://github.com/maarfelipe/credit_score_classification)
- **Project Status**: In Progress
- **Date**: October, 2023
- **Description**: I used Python and machine learning to classify credit scores. I explored the impact of financial attributes such as income, debt, and payment history on creditworthiness.

## About Me

I have a deep passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning. It's incredible how these technologies can be applied to solve real-world problems and make our lives easier. Python has been my primary programming language for machine learning, given its rich ecosystem of libraries, and I've extensively used popular libraries such Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis, Matplotlib and Plotly to visualization/

Machine learning allows me to explore and create intelligent systems that can learn and adapt from data. My goal is to build models that are not only accurate but also ethically sound, taking into consideration fairness and transparency in AI systems. I continue to learn and keep up with the latest advancements in machine learning to create cutting-edge solutions.
