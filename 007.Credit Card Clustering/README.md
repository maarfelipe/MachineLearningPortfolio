Credit card clustering is the task of grouping credit card holders based on their buying habits, credit limits, and many other financial factors. 

Credit card clustering means grouping credit card holders based on their buying habits, credit limits, and many more financial factors. It is also known as credit card segmentation. Such clustering analysis helps businesses find their potential customers and many more marketing strategies.

For the task of credit card clustering with Machine Learning, we need to have a dataset based on buying history of credit card holders. I found an ideal dataset for this task that contains all the necessary features that are enough to understand credit card cluster analysis.
